# Recipe App
This is a fullstack application to keep track of my favorite recipes.

The app uses a React front end with a NodeJS API. It's served by a multi-container Docker setup that's hosted on AWS. For CI/CD I use GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment.

## What I Learned
- Bulding an API with NodeJS
- Developing a front end with React and interacting with an API
- Creating a multi-container Docker setup with docker-compose
- Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Various AWS services (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, IAM, CloudFront)
- Using Terraform to manage AWS Infrastructure
